// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "You map the requirements you gathered to potential components of the software to be developed to ensure that whatever is developed will meet the customer's requirements."
const design = "Here we create the software architecture that will be needed to meet the requirements. UI/UX should be addressed here as well since the most technically proficient software that isn't usable by a non-technical person is ultimately worthless."
const implementation = "Software engineers will get to work in writing the actual code for the proposed software application."
const testingAndIntegration = "QA teams works with the developers to address an bugs in the newly written code."
const maintain = "Not only should any bugs be addressed that may have been missed during the QA procesds, but routine maintenance like patch releases, minor and major revisions, and similar items happen here. Also, metrics should be gathered ona continual basis to indentify areas in which the code can be further optimized for performance and security."
